"""
STAGE 2b: FEATURE ENGINEERING FROM DRIVING HISTORY  (LAB 2)

data/driving_history.csv has one row per policy per month for the 24 months
BEFORE the application. Month 1 is the oldest; month 24 is the month right
before the decision. Columns:

    policy_id, month, miles, trips, hard_brakes, speeding_events,
    night_miles_share, claim_filed

Your job in Lab 2 is to turn 24 rows per driver into ONE row per driver with
features from the families you learned: frequency, recency, velocity,
volatility, extremes, trend, ratio.

THE AS-OF RULE
  Every feature must be computed as of the decision date. In this file that
  means: only rows with month <= DECISION_MONTH may be used. Each function
  receives the history table and must apply that filter itself (use the
  helper as_of()). A test hands your functions a table that ALSO contains
  months 25 to 30 with absurd values; if your output changes, you leaked.

HOW THE STUBS WORK
  A function that returns None is "not implemented" and is skipped, so the
  pipeline runs even if you only finish some. A function that returns a
  pandas Series indexed by policy_id is included under its name.

WHICH ONES YOU MUST IMPLEMENT
  claims_per_month is the guided example (the slides walk you through it).
  Then implement at least FOUR more, from at least FOUR different families,
  including the two families assigned to your last-name group on the exam
  sheet. Record each one in MIDTERM.md under Lab 2: name, family, formula in
  one sentence, and why it should predict claim_free.
